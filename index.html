              <strong>Idea 1</strong>
              <br><br>
              An application that teaches you to play an instrument, piano and guitar.
              The goal of this app would be to get users with no, or little experience playing an instrument to an intermediate knowledge of the instrument and playing.
              <br><br>
              I like the idea of an online teaching tool that is integrated for mobile and tablet devices and having information in one trusted location. The app would use the microphone to listen to the user’s musical playing. The app then uses audio and interactive functions to teach.
              <br><br>
              There are already existing applications that do this, such as Garageband. Garageband is automatically downloaded on Apple computers, so it is easily accessible for mac users. The teaching function is quite outdated though. Their lessons consist of a video with interactive play-along features. There are newer apps such as Yousician, which uses a gamified approach to learning. The app teaches one song at a time, by telling users note by note what to play. This approach to learning can be restrictive to the catalogue of songs available on the application. Other applications include Simply Piano and Rstream Labs.

              <strong>Idea 2</strong>
              <br><br>
              An application that connects online clothing stores into one platform so users can browse multiple stores at once.
              The goal of this application would be to provide users with one place for online clothing shopping that is personalized to their shopping preferences.
              <br><br>
              I like the idea of an application that can serve as a one stop place for online clothing shopping, allowing users to compare prices and styles from different retailers. I want this app to be able to allow users to choose the stores that they shop at the most, so that the items that are reccomended are not random or unknown. The application would be for mobile devices so that it can be used on the go. The app would also make recommendations based on past purchases or popularity.
              <br><br>
              The most popular applications that uses a similar idea is Amazon. Amazon sells everything and is not specialized in clothes, so it is not as commonly used for clothing shopping. The app does offer a wide variety of clothing retailers. ASOS is an online company that sells clothing from a variety of retailers in the UK. The application works well, but it doesn’t take into account customers personal preferences in terms of retailers and styles. Depop is a buying and selling application for vintage clothing. The app looks exactly like instagram in design. Other companies include Finery and ShopStyle.
