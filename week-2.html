            <p><strong>How Might We Summary</strong></p>
            <p>
              <strong>HMW gamify?</strong> I like the idea of gamification, but I don’t want the main focus of the application to be gammified because I don’t find that to be an effective learning method for beginners.<br><br>
              <strong>HMW Track user progress or know level of skill?</strong> I was thinking of sorting lessons by topic (like basics, chords, sheet music etc.)  so users can easily go back to past topics without feeling like they are moving backwards, which can happen in a level based system<br><br>
              <strong>HWM we make it a social experience?</strong> I really like this addition. Like I said earlier, A lot of  people who learn guitar do so to play with their friends. I want to incorporate a jam session type of “game”, where users can jam with their friends while having the learning references available. <br><br>
              <strong>HMW teach users to read music?</strong> Reading sheet music isn’t as common on guitar as reading visual tablatures. Most internet sources for learning a song will use visual tablatures, so I think it will be important for me to explain that in the course. <br><br>
              <strong>HMW get users to keep using it?</strong> I would like to implement weekly reminders, so that users don’t forget what they have learned. For beginners, a couple days off between lessons would make sense because players must build dexterity in their fingers. <br><br>
              <strong>HMW incorporate a real teacher for personal fixes?</strong> I want to have an option for people to chat with instructors and get one on one help. I want the app to gather a guitar playing community, so perhaps having other (more experienced, expert) users help out beginners would be a good way to do so. <br><br>
              <strong>HMW target users who have not yet had an interest in learning an instrument or don’t yet own an instrument?</strong> I want the application to feature a virtual guitar so that users can match their notes to that of the tuned guitar. This would allow users without a guitar the ability to play around with the instrument and get an idea of if they want to pick it up.<br><br>

            <p><strong>Statement of Intent</strong></p>
            <p>The primary goal of my project is to to be a learning tool for users with no, or little, experience playing guitar. They can use the application to reach an intermediate level of knowledge playing the guitar. The secondary goal of this app is to be a reference tool for non-beginner level players. The app will feature note charts and chord charts which are often used by novice and intermediate players.</p>
            <p>I’m focusing on iPhone and iPad platforms because I want the product to be available on a variety of devices. The app uses an AI voice for teaching so screen space should not be an issue. That’s not to say that the application is not screen-based. The application will use the screen to show an interactive guitar.</p>
            <p>This app puts online music learning information in one place. I taught myself to play the guitar using all online resources, but there was never a single website or application that I could use to learn from beginning to end. This application solves the problem of having scattered and fragmented information on the internet by putting it all in one application in a course like atmosphere. It was found that 61% of players want to play guitar by themselves or with friends. Players have different skill sets and would like the ability to learn at their own pace so providing a tool that allows that is appealing. </p>
            <p><i>Keywords <br> </i> Fun | Convenient | Easy | Time-Saving | Gender Neutral </p>
            <p>The primary audience for this application is young people who want to pick up the guitar. Kids are more likely to use an application than older players are because they are more familiar with the technology. They are also in the skill range that my application aims to accommodate. The age range being users 10 - 18 years. I want to appeal to both girls and boys. In a study done by Fender, they found that 50% of today's beginner and aspirational guitar player were female. The secondary audience is users who are older in age, ages 50+, who require a resource for referencing information.  </p>
            <p>Users will want to return to this application because they feel that the application can provide a musical learning experience unlike any other available. The unique learning style will benefit beginner players greatly. The application will have a course like system which allows users to choose what they want to learn so users won’t feel restricted. Users will return because the application will be highly educational and easy to use without being excessive. </p>
            <p>The unique value proposition of my application is that it provides an electronic learning experience for guitar unlike any currently out. It takes advantage of AI voice as well as the built in microphone so that instruments do not need to be plugged in to be heard.</p>
            <p>I will evaluate the success of this application on many factors. The first being the ease of learning. First and foremost, I want the application to offer a better approach to learning music through the use of technology. I don’t want it to be a gimmick or too much of a hassle for users. The application will be a success if it can do those things. I, of course, would also like it to be a well designed application that values ease of use and minimalism. </p>
